# classifying-social-media-comments

The demand to reach and satisfy audiences worldwide also
continues to increase as influencers and content creators use
social media as a primary platform to disseminate their work.
Each video could potentially get a tonne of comments as a
content creator grows, giving them direct feedback from the
viewers. These comments are a major means of understanding
viewer expectations and improving channel engagement.
In this paper, we have proposed approaches to identify and
classify social media comments. A comparative analysis between
Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, and Random forest
has been elaborated in this project.
